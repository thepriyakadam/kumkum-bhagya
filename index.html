             Pragya and Bulbul help their mother Sarla run the Kumkum Bhagya marriage hall.
        The series begins with a short-lived love triangle involving Pragya – Suresh – Bulbul, leading to the cancellation of Pragya's engagement with Suresh.
        Rockstar Abhishek "Abhi" is in a relationship with supermodel Tanushree "Tanu".
        Purab Khanna is Abhishek's best friend and music handler and hires Bulbul at his advertising agency.
        He falls in love with Bulbul despite being engaged to Abhi's sister Aliya.

             Aliya misunderstands that Purab is seeing Pragya and Abhi marries Pragya to keep her from ruining Aliya's relationship with Purab.
        Post-marriage, Pragya realizes the truth and accepts the blame to protect Bulbul.
        On his wedding day, Purab abandons Aliya and comes clean to everyone about his love for Bulbul.
        Various situations and circumstances bring Abhishek and Pragya closer.
        Abhi reconciles with Purab and Bulbul and gets them married.
        Desperate to get Abhi back, Tanu fakes a DNA report to imply that he is the father of her unborn child, which is actually the result of a one-night stand between her and Nikhil.
        Pragya realises the truth but suffers an accident and is declared dead, before she could reveal the truth to Abhi.
